English Wikipedia:

'''Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund Adorno''' (September 11, 1903 - August
    6, 1969) was a German (Germans) sociologist (sociology),
    philosopher (philosophy), musicologist (musicology) and
    composer. He was a member of the Frankfurt School along with Max
    Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse, Jürgen Habermas and
    others. He was also the Music Director of the Radio Project.
    Already as a young music critic and unordained sociologist,
    Theodor W. Adorno was primarily a philosophical thinker. As a
    composer he was unable to step out from under the shadow of his
    teacher Alban Berg. The label 'social philosopher' emphasizes the
    socially critical aspect of his philosophical thinking, which from
    1945 onwards took an intellectually prominent position in the
    Critical Theory of the Frankfurt School.

   "When I made my theoretical model, I could not have guessed that
    people would try to realise it with Molotov cocktails."
